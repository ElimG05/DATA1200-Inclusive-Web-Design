# Inclusive Web Design – Group Exam Project

## 📚 About the Project

This project was created during the first semester as part of the **Inclusive Web Design** course, which introduced us to the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**.

The exam was a **take-home group assignment**, and I had the pleasure of working with:

- **Kristine Emilie Aarak**  
- **Syifa Fatimah Aulia**

At the time, this was one of our first web development experiences. Since then, I’ve grown a lot as a developer and learned new skills that I’m excited to apply to this project.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS

## 🛠️ Plans for Improvement

As part of my learning journey, I would love to:

- Refactor and clean up the existing code  
- Improve accessibility and responsiveness  
- Add **JavaScript** for interactive features  
- Integrate **Bootstrap** for a more modern and responsive design
